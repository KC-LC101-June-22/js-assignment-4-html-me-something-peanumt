      <h2>Toy Biz Spider-Man</h2>
      <img src = "images/17.jpg" width ="400" height ="400" alt = "Toy Biz Spider-Man">
      <p>Here we have the original Toy Biz Spider-Man action figure. This is one of the most expensive action figures I own. 
      I am a HUGE fan of Spider-Man, and I really enjoy have the action figure and a copy of the original comic appearance of Spider-Man.
      I don't plan on taking him out of the box at all.</p>
      <h3>Toy Biz Black Panther</h3>
      <img src="images/15.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt = "Toy Biz Black Panther">
      <p>The next figure on display is the Toy Biz Black Panther action figure. I never thought i'd own a phenomenal figure from a phenomenal comic book line. 
         This one has a special place in my heart because I have a black superhero representation to pass down to my son. </p>
