      <h2>Toy Biz Spider-Man</h2>
      <img src = "images/17.jpg" width ="400" height ="400" alt = "Toy Biz Spider-Man">
      <p>Here we have the original Toy Biz Spider-Man action figure. This is one of the most expensive action figures I own. 
      I am a HUGE fan of Spider-Man, and I really enjoy have the action figure and a copy of the original comic appearance of Spider-Man.
      I don't plan on taking him out of the box at all.</p>
      <h3>Toy Biz Black Panther</h3>
      <img src="images/15.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt = "Toy Biz Black Panther">
      <p>The next figure on display is the Toy Biz Black Panther action figure. I never thought i'd own a phenomenal figure from a phenomenal comic book line. 
         This one has a special place in my heart because I have a black superhero representation to pass down to my son. </p>
      <h4>Kickstarter Spawn</h4>
      <img src="images/12.jpg" width ="400" height="400" alt ="Kickstarter Spawn">
      <p>The next figure in my rather sizable collection that I placed ENTIRELY TOO MUCH value on is the Kickstarter Spawn that was recently released in the last couple of years. 
         This figure also includes multiple weapons and toys and the creators signature along with a reprint of the original first appearance/comic book that the character appeared in. </p>
